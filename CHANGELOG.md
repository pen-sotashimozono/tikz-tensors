# Changelog

One section per version, newest first, headed by its tag. The version is the
`\ProvidesPackage` line of `tex/tikz-tensors.sty`; `scripts/version.py bump`
moves it and opens the section here, and the release on merge carries the
section as its notes.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-29

Tensor-network diagrams only. `\tnnucleus`, `\tnelectron`, `\tncloud` and
`\tncoulomb` (Born–Oppenheimer style pictures) leave the package with their
examples: a project that needs them keeps them locally. What remains is the
notation (`fn`, `coef`, `op` and their wide/tall forms, `frame`, `cont`,
`disc`, `leg`), `\tnswap` and the shared theme.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-09-29

First version: one TikZ format for tensor-network diagrams — wavy legs for
continuous arguments, plain lines for finite indices, circles for functions,
squares for coefficient arrays — and a shared theme (`theme/tokens.toml`)
generating the TeX colours and a CSS file for notes and storyboards.
